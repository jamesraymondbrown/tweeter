# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It allows a user to input new tweets, which is immediately posted to their feed. Tweets are assigned randomized names, handles, and profile pictures, to simulate a number of different users posting to the feed. 

The app has been formatted for both desktop (screen width above 1024px) and mobile (screen width below 1024px) users. 

This app was built with HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX on the front-end, plus Node and Express for the back-end.

## Using the app

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) a new repository using this repository as a template.
2. Clone your repository onto your local device.
3. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser. From there you'll be able to submit and view tweets.
